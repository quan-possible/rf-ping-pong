# Random Forest Ping Pong Season 1

#### Getting Started
To participate in the Random Forest Ping Pong season 1, come join us at the Random Forest room opposite to Gurula! Just play and record your score on our scoreboard. Your game score only counts if **both you and your opponent** report the results on the leaderboard.

#### Rules
To earn points, you can decide to play a best-of-three match, or a single game. A game is played up to 11 points. The server must alternate after every two points scored, and the ball must be hit over the net and bounce once on the opponent's side before they can hit it back.

#### Scoring and Leaderboard
Once a match has been completed, the participants must report the score to the corresponding whiteboard in the Random Forest room. Please visit [our ELO ratings documentation](/elo.md) for more details

#### Conduct
Participants are expected to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner and follow the rules of the game. Any behavior that is deemed inappropriate or unsportsmanlike may result in disqualification from the season.

#### Prizes
It's the friends you make along the way.
